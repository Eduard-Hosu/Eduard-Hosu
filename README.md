### Hi there 👋

My name is **Eduard**, you can call me whatever abbreviation you want (Ed, Edward, ...) I don't mind, choose what's easy for you to pronounce.

I enjoy challenging and engaging new opportunities, which require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge. It helps me to continue learning new languages and development techniques and thereby improves my abilities.

In the past, I worked mostly on GitLab, private workspaces, and projects as a web developer. Feel free to contact me for more details. Most of what you can see here are my recent projects.✨🤩✨

I'm a very curious person, especially interested in software engineering, web development, but also love art, nature, and sports. I mostly spend my free time trying to "feed" my curiosity, going outside with my dog, dancing, climbing, and playing video games of course. 😁.

    🔭 I’m currently working as developer and Co-Founder at [Studylia](https://studylia.com/)
       and also a student at 42Wolfsburg👨‍🎓.
    🌱 I’m currently learning C, C#, German🇩🇪.
